![splitty lifeline thing](https://i.imgur.com/lIlzMxy.png)

The middle line is your life, constructed by you filling in your experiences. Let's call it your lifeline.

The lines on the left are other people joining an experience with you. For example, when I started my current job there'd be a bunch of lines coming in to meet my lifeline from the left, as my experiences are broadly shared with the experiences of everyone at work for a short while.

The lines on the right are other people’s lifelines diverging with yours. If I leave my job, the lifelines of the people I currently work with would fly off to the right as our lifelines diverge. 

I suppose big life events would trigger a big clump of divergences. Normally I guess there’d be a trickle as odd people leave work, drop out of school, move to another country.

When you hover over an experience (i.e. a portion of your lifeline) a little info thingy shows what you were doing and how many other users also have the same portion in their lifeline. 

Perhaps you could add other people to an experience and it’d invite them by showing them a partially filled line, prompting them to fill in the gaps.

Perhaps other people filling in their lifelines could make your own lifeline richer, by lengthening the lifelines flying off to the left and right.
